# Smart Classroom

Although typical classrooms already provide enough for better education, it is very possible to improve them even further by minimalizing any possible distractions, saving time in any non education related things and improving quality of study. With this, our solution is able to fulfill these aspects through the beauty of automation.

Within this file, you will find the general idea behind this project, as well as the full design and components that give the functionalities we want. After it, you can find the needed software requirements coupled with the instructions for installation and deployment.

## General Information

This project aims to reduce the time wasting actions through ways of automation, holding functionalities such as: automation in changing the environment aspects of the classroom, automatic filling of the attendance sheet for the teacher, the student's ability to give feedback and vote for environment changes and finally giving "admin" access to the teacher so they are able to change any of environment factors to their liking (being these last two supported by a web application).
